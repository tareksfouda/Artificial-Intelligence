This program is implemented by Tarek Fouda.
It has three different methods: movebfs, movedfs and moveucs.

The input of the start state should be enetered manually in the main method (Line 70,71,72).

To choose which search technique you want to implement,you will have to comment the other unwanted two methods.
They are in the main method line 85,86,87.

For example:
If you want to implement BFS,uncomment line 85. And comment lines 86 and 87.

		movebfs(root,fringe);
		//movedfs(root,fringe2);
		//moveucs(root,fringe3);
		
		
		
		
The code of the BFS and the UCS gets the optimal solution.
The DFS gets the first solution found.


Maximum number of N to be handled is 14. After 14, it will take more than three minutes to be computed.
