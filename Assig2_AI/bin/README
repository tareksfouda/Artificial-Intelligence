The main method is Nqueens.java. This is the file you have to run to get an output.
By deffault the N of queens is 8. If you want to change it to 16, you have to carefully follow these steps.

* In HillClimbing.java line 4: Change N to be equal to 16
* In Nqueens.java Change line 42 to be 		Queen[] initial = new Queen[16];
* In Nqueens.java change line 63 to be		for(int i=0; i<16; i++){
*In Nqueens.java change line 64 to be		initial[i] = new Queen(gen.nextInt(16),i);	

* In Queen.java   change method move down at line 31 to be    	public void moveDown(int cells){
																this.row = this.row+cells;
		
																//bound check/reset
																	if(row>15 && row%15!=0){
																		row=(row%15)-1;
																							}
																else if(row>15 && row%15==0){
																		row=15;
																							}
																								}  		
																								
									Or simply replace every 7 with a 15 in this method.\
									
									
* In state.java replace line 4 with N=16
